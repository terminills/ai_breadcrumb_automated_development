# Enhanced Session Tracking with Breadcrumb Recall

## Overview

The session management system has been enhanced with detailed breadcrumb tracking and recall mechanisms to provide deeper insight into AI decision-making and prevent repeated work.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Breadcrumb Usage Tracking

Every breadcrumb consulted during a session is now tracked with:
- **Usage count**: How many times each breadcrumb was referenced
- **File location**: Which file and line number
- **Context**: Phase, status, pattern, and strategy information
- **Influence**: Which decisions were influenced by each breadcrumb

### 2. Pattern Recognition and Reuse

The system automatically:
- Extracts reusable patterns from breadcrumbs
- Calculates success rates for each pattern
- Recommends patterns based on past successes
- Tracks which patterns were applied in current session

### 3. Duplicate Work Detection

When exploring code, the system:
- Identifies similar completed tasks from breadcrumbs
- Warns about potentially duplicate work
- Suggests reusing existing approaches
- Tracks work items avoided due to recall

### 4. Breadcrumb Influence Mapping

Each decision tracks:
- Which breadcrumbs influenced the decision
- Type of decision (exploration, reasoning, generation, review)
- Timestamp of influence
- Decision details

## New Session Fields

Sessions now include:

```python
{
    'breadcrumb_influences': [        # List of influence records
        {
            'timestamp': '2025-10-17T...',
            'decision_type': 'generation',
            'decision_details': 'Generated code using...',
            'breadcrumbs_used': ['file.c:123', 'file.c:456'],
            'breadcrumb_count': 2
        }
    ],
    'breadcrumb_usage': {             # Usage count per breadcrumb
        'file.c:123': 3,
        'file.c:456': 2
    },
    'patterns_recalled': [            # Patterns identified and used
        'MMU_PTR_CAST_V2',
        'THREAD_SAFE_INIT'
    ],
    'work_avoided': [                 # Similar completed work found
        {
            'description': 'GPU initialization',
            'patterns': ['DEVICE_INIT_V1'],
            'status': 'IMPLEMENTED'
        }
    ]
}
```

## UI Enhancements

### Live Updates Log

Now shows:
- Pattern detection: `üéØ Identified 3 reusable patterns`
- Duplicate work detection: `‚ö†Ô∏è Detected 1 similar completed tasks - can reuse approaches`

### Session Details Panel

New "Breadcrumb Recall & Pattern Reuse" section shows:
- Number of breadcrumbs consulted
- Patterns recalled with names
- Work items avoided (highlighted in green)
- Number of breadcrumb influences tracked
- Most frequently used breadcrumbs

## Benefits

### 1. Transparency
- See exactly which breadcrumbs influenced which decisions
- Understand how patterns are being reused
- Track what work was avoided

### 2. Efficiency
- Automatic detection of duplicate work
- Pattern reuse recommendations
- Learning from past successes

### 3. Compliance with Breadcrumb Spec
- Sessions now actively follow the breadcrumb spec
- Better recall through breadcrumb usage
- Prevents repeating work twice by tracking similar completed tasks

### 4. Debugging
- Easy to identify why certain decisions were made
- Track which breadcrumbs were most influential
- Analyze pattern success rates

## Usage Examples

### Python API

```python
from src.interactive_session import SessionManager

# Create session manager
session_mgr = SessionManager(model_loader, aros_path, log_path)

# Start session
session_id = session_mgr.start_session(
    "Implement GPU driver",
    context={'project': 'gpu_driver'}
)

# Explore with breadcrumb tracking
exploration = session_mgr.explore("GPU initialization")
# Automatically tracks breadcrumbs consulted, patterns found, duplicate work

# Get recall statistics
recall_stats = session_mgr.get_breadcrumb_recall_stats()
print(f"Breadcrumbs consulted: {recall_stats['breadcrumbs_consulted']}")
print(f"Patterns recalled: {recall_stats['unique_patterns']}")
print(f"Work avoided: {recall_stats['work_items_avoided']}")

# End session with statistics
session_mgr.end_session('completed')
# Logs comprehensive breadcrumb recall statistics
```

### Web UI

1. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/sessions
2. Create or view a session
3. Click "Show Details" on any session
4. Scroll to "üìö Breadcrumb Recall & Pattern Reuse" section
5. View:
   - Breadcrumbs consulted
   - Patterns recalled
   - Work avoided (in green)
   - Most used breadcrumbs

## Implementation Details

### Breadcrumb Tracking

```python
# Track usage when breadcrumb is consulted
breadcrumb_key = f"{file_path}:{line_number}"
self.breadcrumb_usage_tracker[breadcrumb_key] += 1
self.current_session['breadcrumb_usage'][breadcrumb_key] = count

# Store detailed information
breadcrumb_details.append({
    'key': breadcrumb_key,
    'phase': phase,
    'status': status,
    'pattern': pattern,
    'usage_count': count
})
```

### Pattern Extraction

```python
patterns = {}
for bc in breadcrumbs:
    pattern = bc.get('pattern')
    if pattern:
        patterns[pattern] = {
            'count': count,
            'success_rate': calculate_success_rate(bc),
            'statuses': statuses
        }
```

### Influence Tracking

```python
self._track_breadcrumb_influence(
    decision_type='generation',
    decision_details='Generated code using insights',
    breadcrumbs_used=['file.c:123', 'file.c:456']
)
```

### Duplicate Work Detection

```python
def _check_breadcrumbs_for_duplicate_work(breadcrumbs, query):
    duplicate_work = []
    for bc in breadcrumbs:
        if bc['status'] in ['IMPLEMENTED', 'FIXED']:
            if similar_to_query(bc, query):
                duplicate_work.append(bc)
    return duplicate_work
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Pattern Recommendation Engine**: AI suggests which patterns to use based on context
2. **Breadcrumb Similarity Scoring**: More sophisticated matching of similar work
3. **Cross-Session Learning**: Learn patterns across all sessions
4. **Visual Breadcrumb Graph**: Interactive visualization of breadcrumb influences
5. **Automated Pattern Documentation**: Generate pattern documentation from usage

## Testing

To test the enhanced session tracking:

```bash
# Start the UI server
cd ui && python app.py

# Create a demo session with breadcrumb tracking
# Navigate to http://localhost:5000/sessions
# Click "Create Session" with demo_mode enabled
# Watch the live updates log and click "Show Details"
```

The demo mode simulates breadcrumb consultation and pattern detection without requiring actual PyTorch models.
