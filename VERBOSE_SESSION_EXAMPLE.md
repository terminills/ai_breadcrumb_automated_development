🎯 Reasoning Complete

📝 Strategy Formulated:
   Based on the exploration, the implementation should follow this approach:
   1. First implement PCI device detection in radeonsi_init.c
   2. Set up memory management structures for VRAM allocation
   3. Initialize GPU command submission queues
   4. Configure basic register access macros
   5. Implement buffer object creation and management
   6. Add synchronization primitives for GPU/CPU coordination
   7. Connect to LLVM shader compilation backend
   8. Set up debugging and error handling infrastructure
   9. Implement power management hooks
   10. Add device capability detection

🎯 Chosen Approach: Incremental implementation starting with device detection

## Benefits of Enhanced Verbosity

1. **Transparency**: Users can see exactly what the AI is examining and why
2. **Debugging**: When things go wrong, detailed logs make it easier to understand what happened
3. **Learning**: Users can learn from the AI's decision-making process
4. **Trust**: Seeing the thought process builds confidence in the system
5. **Reproducibility**: Detailed logs help reproduce and understand past decisions
6. **Verification**: Easy to verify that the AI is actually examining relevant files and breadcrumbs

## Testing the Enhanced Logging

To see the enhanced logging in action:

1. Start the UI server:
   ```bash
   cd ui && python app.py
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:5000/sessions

3. Create a new demo session with "Demo Mode" enabled

4. Watch the Live Updates log for detailed progress

5. Click "Show Details" on any session to see comprehensive phase information

The demo mode simulates the AI's work without requiring actual PyTorch models, making it perfect for testing the UI and logging enhancements.
