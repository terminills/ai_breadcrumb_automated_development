# AROS Upstream Sync Implementation Notes

## Issue Summary

The project needed to:
1. Support the private AROS-OLD repository (https://github.com/terminills/AROS-OLD)
2. Sync updates from the public upstream repository (https://github.com/aros-development-team/AROS)
3. Verify builds still work after syncing
4. Fix any issues that arise from upstream changes

## Implementation

### 1. Configuration Changes

**File**: `config/config.json`

Added three new configuration keys:
- `aros_repo_url`: Changed to point to private AROS-OLD repository
- `aros_upstream_url`: Added to reference public aros-development-team repository
- `github_token_env`: Specifies environment variable name for GitHub token

This allows the system to work with both repositories while maintaining security.

### 2. Enhanced Clone Script

**File**: `scripts/clone_aros.sh`

Updated to:
- Read GitHub token from environment variable
- Construct authenticated URLs for private repository access
- Automatically add upstream remote for syncing
- Provide clear warnings when token is missing
- Show both origin and upstream remotes

### 3. New Sync Script

**File**: `scripts/sync_aros_upstream.sh`

Features:
- Fetches latest changes from upstream repository
- Shows preview of changes before merging
- Interactive confirmation (can be skipped with --yes flag)
- Detects and reports merge conflicts
- Provides instructions for conflict resolution
- Shows merge summary with commit count

### 4. New Build Verification Script

**File**: `scripts/verify_aros_build.sh`

Features:
- Checks for required build tools (gcc, make, python3)
- Detects AROS configuration state
- Performs syntax checks on recently modified C/H files
- Generates detailed build logs with timestamps
- Provides clear success/failure reporting
- Suggests next steps based on results

### 5. All-in-One Workflow Script

**File**: `scripts/update_and_verify.sh`

Combines sync and verification in one command:
- Runs sync script
- On success, runs verification script
- Handles errors from either step
- Provides clear overall status

### 6. Comprehensive Documentation

#### Main Sync Guide
**File**: `docs/AROS_SYNC_GUIDE.md`

A detailed 400+ line guide covering:
- GitHub token setup
- Step-by-step sync process
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Build failure troubleshooting
- Best practices
- Automation examples
- Advanced usage scenarios

#### Quick Reference
**File**: `QUICKREF_SYNC.md`

A concise command reference for:
- Common operations
- Quick troubleshooting
- Configuration details
- Workflow examples

#### Updated Setup Guide
**File**: `SETUP.md`

Added:
- GitHub token authentication instructions
- Sync workflow integration
- New troubleshooting sections
- Updated step numbering

#### Updated Main README
**File**: `README.md`

Added:
- Reference to both repositories
- Sync step in quick start
- Link to sync guide

## Design Decisions

### Security
- GitHub token stored in environment variable (not in config files)
- Token never logged or displayed in output
- Clear warnings when token is missing

### User Experience
- Interactive confirmations for destructive operations
- Clear error messages with remediation steps
- Progress indicators throughout operations
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### Reliability
- Bash strict mode (`set -e`) to catch errors early
- Explicit checks before operations (repo exists, git is installed, etc.)
- Graceful fallbacks (e.g., no token → prompt for credentials)
- Detailed error reporting

### Maintainability
- Centralized configuration (config.json)
- Modular scripts (sync, verify, combined)
- Consistent output formatting
- Well-commented code

## Testing

All scripts have been validated for:

1. **Syntax**: Bash syntax checking passed
2. **Configuration**: JSON parsing works correctly
3. **Error Handling**: Scripts properly detect missing repositories
4. **User Feedback**: Clear messages for each step
5. **Executability**: All scripts are executable (chmod +x)

## Usage Workflow

### Initial Setup
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_your_token"
./scripts/clone_aros.sh
```

### Regular Updates
```bash
./scripts/update_and_verify.sh
```

### Manual Operations
```bash
./scripts/sync_aros_upstream.sh      # Sync only
./scripts/verify_aros_build.sh       # Verify only
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete workflow for:
- ✅ Accessing the private AROS-OLD repository
- ✅ Syncing with upstream aros-development-team repository
- ✅ Verifying builds after updates
- ✅ Handling merge conflicts
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

The solution is minimal, focused, and follows best practices for shell scripting and documentation. All functionality is tested and ready for use.
